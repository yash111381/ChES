# ChES
Website for Chemical Engineering Society - NIT Surat

The scope of the website is to provide a medium for communication between the core team members of CHES organizing events and the students of the college and other colleges even(if intended). Along with this, it will even act as a medium of connection for the juniors to get hands-on details about the projects worked on by their seniors, and get appropriate help from them. It would allow the members to make new posts regarding event’s date, time, schedule, poster, specification/s etc.

Three potential groups of viewers/editors exist:
1.	Students of the college who visit the site for gaining information about events being held or getting some details about the seniors so as to guide them in that specific topic.
2.	Students from other colleges who visit the site, who will be provided information about CHES, what it is, what it stands for and even the details of any event, (and may include link for any event registration for them.)
3.	Core team members of CHES, who will be posting about events through log in, edit or change any details specific to past events, change their personal profile, and even maintain their personal blog.*
(May be static for version 1 and blog may be implemented by version 2)

The goal of this website is to increase the reach of this specific student chapter, CHES to more and more students in the college as well as outside the college and even gain publicity for some of the events.


Benefits for using the site should include:
•	Complete information about CHES, what it stands for and its team members.
•	Events and other information already conducted or to be conducted by the same.
•	Timely and up to date information that encourages readers to return to the site.
•	Ability to view profiles of seniors so as to help the juniors in any specific project topic they are planning to do.
